# hello-world

Hello, I'm Fernando Hernandez, a software developer from Costa Rica. I have a strong background in the field and I'm passionate about creating technological solutions. My expertise lies in software development using various technologies and programming languages.

I feel comfortable working with technologies like .NET, Python, JavaScript, and Java, and I have a solid command of database engines such as SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I have experience in web application development using popular frameworks like Angular and React, enabling me to create attractive and functional user interfaces.

I'm excited about the world of data search and analysis, and I've acquired knowledge in Elasticsearch, a powerful tool for this purpose. I also have experience in Apache Nifi, an ETL platform that allows me to handle and transform data in real-time.

As a software developer, I strive to provide efficient and high-quality solutions. I enjoy taking on new challenges and learning new technologies to stay up-to-date in this ever-evolving field.

If you need assistance with software development or have any technology-related questions, feel free to reach out. I'm here to help.

If you have any other questions, I'll be happy to assist you!
